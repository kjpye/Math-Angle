  By default, the returned string looks similar to «-43° 26' 4.2841"», but
  is significantly configurable.

  The symbols used to represent degrees, minutes and seconds can be changed
  by specifying the named paramaters C<degsym>, C<minsym> and C<secsym>
  respectively.

  The representation of seconds can be changed by specifying a printf
  format string for the C<secfmt> named parameter.

  The representation of positive and negative numbers can be changed by
  specifying the values of the C<presign> and C<postsign> named parameters.
  The first character of C<presign> is printed before a positive angle.
  The second character is printed after a positive angle.
  Similarly the characters of C<postsign> are printed before and after
  a negative angle. If any character of C<presign> or C<postsign>
  is a space, then it is not printed.

  Thus, if the angle above represented a latitude, then specifying
  C<presign> as '  ' (two spaces), and C<postsign> as 'NS', then the
  returned string would be «43° 23' 4.2841"S».

  The C<separator> named parameter can be specified to change the separator
  between the degress and minutes, and between the minutes and seconds.

  Grammar C<DMS> matches a string representing an angle specified in
  degrees, minutes, and seconds.

  The string consists of an optional sign, followed by fields representing
  the number of degrees, minutes and seconds in that order—although each
  field is optional—followed by an optional 'N', 'S", 'E" or 'W' also
  representing the sign of the angle. (If a leading and trailing sign
  are both specified, then they are both applied—remember that two
  negatives make a positive.)

  Each of the three numeric fields consists of a number followed by
  a units designator. The degree field is marked either by
  a degree symbol (C<°>) or by the letter C<d> in ether case.
  Similarly the minutes field is indicated by a prime symbol (C<′>, C<U+2032>),
  a single quote (C<'>) or the letter 'm',
  and the seconds field by a double prime symbol (C<″>, C<U+2033>),
  a double quote (C<">), or the letter 's'.

  Note that in the following grammar, if the last field specified (normally
  seconds, but could be something else if the seconds field is missing) uses
  an alphabetic character to specify the type, then any following sign
  indicator must be separated from the type by whitespace.
  This is a bug!
